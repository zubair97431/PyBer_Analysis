## Challenge

#The summary dataframe includes the "Total Rides", "Total Drivers", "Total Fares", "Average Fare per Ride", and "Average Fare per Driver" for each city type ("Rural", "Urban", "Suburban"). It appears the most number of costs, rides, and drivers occurred in the Urban city type however average fares were much lower due to rides being more utilized. On the other hand, for rural, the first 3 columns might have had lower outputs but the average fares for rides and drivers were much higher than the urban city types. 

#The multiple line graph shows each city type's trend in fares overtime. For rural city types, April seems to be the highest it has had in fares. For suburban, late February seems like the peak for fares while declining to eventually rise again in late April. For urban city types, the peak for fares seemed to be in early March but overall this city type did well. 

#Overall, the urban city data type was the most successful. Its high position in fares was a factor to this and even though its trend in time appeared to be volatile, the urban city data type still managed to stay above suburban and rural. Judging from the summary dataframe, the average fares per ride and per driver respectively were much lower due to rides being more utilized.
